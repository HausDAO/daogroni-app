        I knew it was Beast, even though he was the most beautiful golden
        furred, fluffy bunny. We normally raid together, so our most common
        setting is blowing the vacant skulls off of zombies and other various
        monsters.

        I had a feeling he’d be here. He doesn’t usually show up for concerts in
        the metaverse, but this one was blue grass or appalachian. I’m not
        exactly sure, which is embarrassing, but I brought a couple DAOgroni
        drinks and maybe it’s easier to get to know someone when the music
        reaches deep in ourselves.

      <Text mb={2}>“Beast.” I waved to him. </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Sapphire, I didn’t recognize you.”</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Yeah, I dressed to look approachable.”</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>I shook my head no.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“You look like Rockbiter.” He laughed. </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “That’s exactly who I was thinking of, annoying and ugly.”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Totally approachable.”</Text>
      He moved closer to me. We both laughed. Hopefully, he didn’t notice that
      mine was nervous.
      <Text mb={2}> “You were pretty intense on that last raid.”</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>His golden fur seemed like it swirled underwater.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Last night?” I asked.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>He nodded, yes.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Oh, yeah, I get violent.” Luckily, rocks don’t blush.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“You were bad ass.” He said. “Really?” </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Yeah!”</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “I just really get into killing monsters. I like using big weapons on an
        obvious enemy. When there’s more ambiguity, I prefer puzzles.” I tried
        to steady my breathing, which probably made me sound out of breath.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Oh me too. I like puzzle games where you have to figure out the best
        outcome of a complex and complicated situation.” He started to hop
        towards the edge of the grassy field. I followed, with my clumsy rock
        steps.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“Are you meeting anyone here?” I asked.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>“No, are you?” He replied.</Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “No.” I didn’t know how to position my limbs. “Have you ever had a drink
        with someone in the Metaverse?”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Once, but it was only standing near a bar height table with glasses on
        it.”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “I’ve never done that, but I have two DAOgroni NFTs we could have. Only
        if you’d like that?”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Really? That sounds great! I’ll send you some weth for it?”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Well, can I buy you a drink?” He couldn’t see it, but I was twirling my
        ponytail.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        He was quiet. I wanted to say something to fill the silence, but didn’t
        know what.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Sorry, my headset died.” He finally said something, but I still didn’t
        know if he wanted a drink.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “I can send the NFT to you and then when you drink the cocktail, you get
        loot in the DAO.” I wish I had said, when we drink.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Oh, I’ve heard about DAOgroni drinks, but never saw one.” He said.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “So, would you mind if I send it to your wallet?” I wish my rock skin
        could camouflage.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>
        “Oh, I’m sorry,” he said, “my headset must have died before I told you
        that yes, I would really enjoy that.”
      </Text>
      <Text mb={2}>I muted myself and let out a giant exhale.</Text>
